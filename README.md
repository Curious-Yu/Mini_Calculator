# [Mini Calculator](https://curious-yu.github.io/Mini_Calculator/)

This is a basic calculator that built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are 3 JavaScript functions: to clear/reset the calculator, to enter values, and to calculate/evaluate the values. This project used the global JavaScript function, ```eval()``` to calculate/evalute the values. The reset() function is created to clear/reset the calculator display. The display() function is created to display the entered and calculated value.
